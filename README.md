<h3>Problem 1 </h3>

While prospecting for restaurants, retailers, and grocery stores in the U.S, I realized I was never able to find an exhaustive list of all organizations in each of these verticals. As a result, I spent a lot of time scouring different lists online to find brands I might have missed.

<h3> Solution </h3>

Using the Google Knowledge Graph API, I built a tool that automatically searches the web for different organizations in the "restaurant", "retail", or "grocery categories" and generates a list for me.
